Installing
----------
Copy the AuditionClient X360 folder onto the xbox harddrive.

The FMOD AuditionClient X360.xex should apppear in the dashboard executable list.  
Run the executable to start the auditionclient.

Instructions on use
-------------------
Connect to the AuditionClient from FMOD Designer by going to the 'Audition' menu then 
'Manage Connections' menu and adding the name and IP address of the Xbox devkit as a new entry.

The IP address you should add is displayed from inside the AuditionClient application on the 
screen in the lower left.

To connect to the Xbox click 'connect' in the connections dialog.

Now you can play events and change parameters from designer, and the audio output will come 
from the Xbox itself, rather than FMOD Designer.

A spectrum, speaker levels and oscilliscope is displayed for user feedback.

A small flashing dot above the 'Channels Playing' display will give visible feedback to whether 
the application is still executing on the Xbox or not.


Quitting the program
---------------------
Press 'start' and 'back' at the same time to quit.
